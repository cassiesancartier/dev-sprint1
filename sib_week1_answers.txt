*** What is the for loop doing? ***


- What is a route, and how do you specify one in Flask?
A route is what Flask uses to bind a function to a URL.  To specify one in Flask, you use the @app.route() decorator, and different parts of the route can be specified as variables (using <>) or converted (using <converter:int/string...>etc).

- What is the only route we’ve specified in our application?
The route that we've specified is '/'.

- What is the method that gets called when we hit that route?
The function def hello() is called, which returns "Hello Internet!"

- If I wanted to add a route at “/world” that printed “Hello, World” on the screen, what would that code look like?

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/world")
def hello_world():
    return "Hello World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

- If I create a new application and import testingflask.py (a.k.a. I am not running it directly), will code under the ‘if __name__ == “__main__”: be executed? Why not?

No, that code will not be executed because if __name__ == "__main__" will be false.  Instead, __name__ == 'testingflask', since that is where the function that is being called sits. When you run a function that is imported from another file, all of the function and class definitions from the other file are run, but not its main() code.
